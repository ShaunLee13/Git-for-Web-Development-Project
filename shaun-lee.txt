Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Inline takes place on a single line of code and doesn't separate itself from other content, whereas blocks can span several lines and separates itself from content both before
    and after the block. Inlines also can be placed within blocks, but not vice-versa, nor can inlines be placed in inlines.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    It's position is taken out of the flow of the structure. It's then positioned relative to its closest ancestor, or in the event that it has no ancestor, the block it's held in.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    The width:#% combined with padding: would ensure that it fits inside a space you need.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?

    by adjusting the margins and paddings.
